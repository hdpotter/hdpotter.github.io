<h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
<img src="photo.png" width="32%" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px">
<p>I'm currently gainfully unemployed, working fulltime on a combination of game development, language and other software development, creative writing, and learning in general.</p>
<p>I'm an academic by trade, with one doctorate in physics and another in computer science.
In the physics department, I worked on GPU acceleration for a nuclear structure supercomputer codebase.
For computer science, I studied molecular programming and DNA nanotechnology, and worked on a variety of related projects.
I'm also interested in formal verification, proof engineering, and programming languages.</p>
<p>I love gamedev!
I'm interested in a wide variety of related topics, but my particular focus is voxel technology, factory automation games, and in general any genres that involve complex simulation state.
I also think procedural generation techniques are pretty cool.</p>
<p>My language of choice is Rust, with its zero-cost abstractions, ergonomic but close-to-the-metal performance, and secure, compile-time memory management.
Besides Rust, I'm a big fan of C#.</p>
<p>Outside of software and game development, I'm a hiker and, of course, an avid player of video games.
I'm a hobbyist musician, making up with enthusiasm what I lack in skill, and I read and watch a lot of fantasy and science fiction.
<em>Locked Tomb</em>, <em>Arcane</em>, <em>Expanse</em>, and the Baru Cormorant series are some of my favorites.</p>
