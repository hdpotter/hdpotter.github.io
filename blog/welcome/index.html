    Welcome
</h1>
<p class="blog-post-date">2024-06-04</p>
<p>Welcome to my website, and welcome to my blog!</p>
<p>I already have an about me page, but I'm going to say a few things here as well.
That way this page can stay the same while I update the other one, and I can take a look back in a decade.</p>
<p>I'm Hugh Potter, currently unemployed and doing my level best to enjoy life!
I like software, computing, and things that make things.
A program is a thing that does or makes something cool.
A compiler is a program that makes programs; how cool is that!
Ask me about K'nex computers sometime - I have a lot of thoughts.</p>
<p>I love human language and how it works.
I also like music and art, and I like how they intersect with math and code.
I love gamedev because it's a synthesis of all those things and more besides: a medium that is both technically and artistically fulfilling, whose end product is a piece of interactive art with incredible potential for immersion.</p>
<p>I expect this blog to cover a variety of topics in the general area of math, gamedev, Rust, music, and the like.
Next up is hex grids and procedural content!</p>
